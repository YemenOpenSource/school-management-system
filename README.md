## It's a trivial projectðŸ˜‘, why you did it?
yes, I agree, it was a challenge doing the following:
+ Learn Nextjs from the docs only and build the project directly.
+ Avoid using libraries, just using axios, and tailwind.
+ Deep dive into typescript and meet the validations types.
+ Building a structured native [fetchResponse function](./lib/utils.ts) and retunred schema semulates the [React Query Library](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) from scratch to make the components clear and more readable, the following snippet explains the concept
```tsx
if (isSuccess) {
    content = JsxData;
  }
  if (isEmpty) {
    content = JsxDataIsEmpty;
  }
  if (isError) {
    content = JsxDataIsError;
  } 
```
+ Building all the UI and reusable [components](./components/ui) from scratch and make them compatable with any library like [react hook form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/).
+ Never use cookies in the client components and depends on the api responses.

## What you got form this project Safwan?
+ Discovered the importance of the documentations after the youtube tutorials, thus now I can dive into any documentation confidently.
+ Native and vanilla js and react concepts for some logics like data fetching and how I can make theme natively.
+ System design and the best practice creating reusable and UI components.
+ finally: it was enjoyable experienceðŸ˜… dealing with only documentations and rid of youtube 100 hoursðŸ˜‘ tutorials.

Note: not all youtube's tutorials bad, but as a software engineer you must depends on the original source "docs" then you can use other ones
